In-place tweak injection with insert_dylib and ChOma.  
Proudly written in SwiftUI.  

Expected to work on all iOS versions supported by opa334â€™s TrollStore (i.e. iOS 14.0 - 17.0).

## Limitations

- [x] Removable system applications
- [x] Decrypted App Store applications (TrollStore applications)
- [x] Encrypted App Store applications with bare dynamic library

## Build

See GitHub Actions for the latest build status.

PRs are always welcome.

## Milestones

- [x] `optool` is buggy so we need to compile a statically linked `install_name_tool` or `llvm-install-name-tool` on iOS to achieve a smaller package size.
- [x] Support for `.deb` or `.zip`.
